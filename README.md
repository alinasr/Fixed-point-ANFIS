# Fixed-point-ANFIS-
Fixed-point ANFIS RMSE calculation for Linux based embedded systems to employ in  randomized evolutionary machine learning algorithm

for more information about ANFIS, why we used fixed-point number representation and other important information refer to this papar : https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.07.007

*Note: pleas use this command to compile the code in linux :
g++ -O3 -std=c++0x main.cpp anfis.cpp loaddata.cpp -o anfis
